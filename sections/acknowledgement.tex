I'm grateful for the Marcus Wallenberg Laboratory for Sound and Vibration. It was a pleasure to work in this laboratory and use their facilities. It was for me a great opportunity to work in this acoustic environment.

I also want to show my gratitude to Luck Peerlings who helped me a lot. Thank you for your time and you very clear explanations. 

I want to specially thank my supervisor Hans Bod√©n. The subject he proposed was very interesting and stimulating. I learn a lot of acoustic knowledge thanks to him. He gave me the opportunity to do high valued measurements with a rare setup.

I thank my co-workers and all the people with I spent a great time.
